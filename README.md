# Linear-Regression-Analysis-for-Effect-of-Asbestos-exposure-on-pulmonary-function-testing

Linear regression analysis in the context of the effect of asbestos exposure on pulmonary function testing involves examining the relationship between asbestos exposure and pulmonary function test results. Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

Here's how the analysis might be conducted:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - **Dependent Variable (Response):** Pulmonary function test results (e.g., forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume).
   - **Independent Variable (Predictor):** Asbestos exposure level during the years 1984-1990.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - Collect data on pulmonary function test results for individuals.
   - Collect data on asbestos exposure levels for the same individuals during the specified time period.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values or outliers if necessary.
   - Check for the normality and linearity assumptions of linear regression.

4. **Model Specification:**
   - Formulate the linear regression model: \( Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon \)
     - \( Y \): Pulmonary function test results (dependent variable)
     - \( X \): Asbestos exposure level during 1984-1990 (independent variable)
     - \( \beta_0 \): Intercept
     - \( \beta_1 \): Coefficient representing the effect of asbestos exposure
     - \( \epsilon \): Error term

5. **Parameter Estimation:**
   - Use statistical methods to estimate the regression coefficients (\( \beta_0 \) and \( \beta_1 \)).
   - Assess the significance of the coefficients and the overall fit of the model.

6. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Test hypotheses to determine if there is a significant relationship between asbestos exposure and pulmonary function test results.

7. **Interpretation:**
   - Interpret the estimated coefficients in the context of the study.
   - Assess the direction and strength of the relationship between asbestos exposure and pulmonary function.

8. **Validation:**
   - Validate the model using appropriate techniques, such as cross-validation, to assess its predictive performance.
